    "recommendationText": "During the past year as Director of Tutoring, I've had the pleasure of getting to know Corey as a tutor. With 200+ remote tutors on the team, it's a challenge to know or engage meaningfully with every tutor, but Corey always stood out in a positive way. Corey shared her positive energy not only with students, but with other tutors, as well as the team leads. She engaged regularly with other tutors seeking answers to their questions. She was diligent about keeping up with the constant updates our team has been challenged with this past year, asking for clarification when needed. Her communication with the tutor management team was always positive, professional, and timely. Corey put her students first even during very challenging personal times, and her students were loyal to her for it. Losing Corey from the tutoring team is a huge loss for our students and our entire team. I recommend Corey to any employer who is looking for someone who is dedicated, positive, patient, and effective."
